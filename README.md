### Overview
This web app is a comprehensive course planner that allows students to manage their coursework in a seamless manner. Users can easily add, edit, and delete courses and categorize them by their organized status, whether they have taken the course, plan to take it, or want to take it. This allows for easy management of coursework and ensures that users can meet their academic requirements.

The web app also facilitates collaboration among students, as users can share their coursework with others, find students taking the same class, and make informed decisions about what classes to take. This feature helps create a supportive community of learners and enhances the academic journey.

The grade calculator feature enables users to calculate their final course grade and current GPA based on the courses they have taken. This feature is particularly useful for students who need to maintain a certain GPA or want to track their academic performance.

### Data Organization
There will be a starting amount of 4 tables that we think we will need. A table to hold the user data, course data, the courses that a student is taking and finally a table to hold school information. Students will need a database table of their courses, previously taken and currently taking. There will also be a database table for all available courses that a student can take, and a database table to categorize them by major/minor requirements. Maybe adding a database table of all the schools to categorize them by school as well. There would also be a database table showing recommended/shared plans from other users for collaborations.

Our 4 initial tables are below:
<table>
<tr><td>

|User Table|

|UserId|
|SchoolId|
|FirstName|
|LastName|
